                    Chicken Fillets are fillets of meat sliced horizontally from a chicken breast, such that it makes a “steak” of a shape 
                    that can be ideal to fit on a bun, etc.<br><br>

                    They are available in many different forms of preparation, such as raw, cooked, breaded, breaded and spiced, etc.<br><br>

                    Many retailers confuse the terms, Fillets and Cutlets. The essential different is that cutlets are thinner because they 
                    have been pounded or formed to make them thinner.<br><br>

                    Sometimes you will see the phrase “thigh fillets” but what they actually mean is “thigh cutlets.” Occasionally you will 
                    also see the word “fillets” used to mean “strips of boneless chicken” for stir fries, etc, in which the fillet is cut 
                    into long thin strips. What they really mean is “Chicken Breast Strips.” </font><br></td>
